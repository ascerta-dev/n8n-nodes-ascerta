# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **SBOM:** Added missing dev dependencies (`@types/node`, `vitest`); refreshed last-updated date.

### Fixed
- **Docs:** README and deployment guide referenced the wrong Databricks credential type (`databricks` / `databricksApi` from `n8n-nodes-databricks`); corrected to the package's own `ascertaDatabricksApi` credential. Removed the bogus instruction to install a separate `n8n-nodes-databricks` package.
- **Docs:** Toolkit link in README pointed at a non-existent repo (`ascerta/ascerta-n8n-toolkit`); corrected to `ascerta-dev/utilities`.
- **Docs:** Removed broken links to `docs/reference/databricks/index.md` (path doesn't exist) in `docs/providers/databricks.md`; replaced with an Ascerta support pointer for Agent Bricks / bulk-ingest workloads.
- **Docs:** Replaced placeholder Databricks endpoint example `databricks-gpt-5-4` with realistic endpoint names.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- Banner version updated — UX only.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- **Use Case ID default is now the n8n execution ID.** New Ascerta nodes added to a workflow default `xProxy-UseCase-ID` to `={{ $execution.id }}` instead of `provider/model/executionId`. Each workflow run gets its own Ascerta use case — calls made within a single execution aggregate together, calls across runs do not. Existing nodes in saved workflows keep their old expression and are unaffected; clear the Use Case ID field on a node to pick up the new default. Use Case Name (workflow name) is unchanged.

### Fixed
- **Use Case Step default no longer throws an expression error.** The previous default `={{ $node.name }}` was invalid — `$node` in n8n is a lookup proxy for *other* nodes, not an accessor for the current node, so the expression threw "The node 'name' doesn't exist." Default is now a literal node display name (e.g. `Ascerta Databricks (Proxy)`), passed in by each node so a sensible Step header is sent without any expression evaluation. Override with a custom label (e.g. "Step 1 - Outline") for multi-step workflows.
- **Use Case Step now reports the canvas display name** (e.g. `Ascerta DBX #4 - Summarizer`) when the user hasn't overridden the field. Each chat-model node falls back to `this.getNode().name` at runtime, so multi-step workflows show distinct steps in Ascerta instead of one generic label.
- **Non-ASCII characters in tracking headers are sanitized** (`·` → `-`, `—` → `-`, smart quotes → ASCII). Without this, n8n's HTTP path either threw `ByteString` errors or sent malformed headers that Ascerta 400'd with empty bodies. New `utils/headers.ts` applies to every `xProxy-*` value across all five chat-model nodes.
- **Ascerta Databricks (Proxy) chat model crashed with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bind')` on n8n 2.19.x.** `@langchain/openai@1.x` (shipped with current n8n) refactored `ChatOpenAI` so that `completionWithRetry` lives on `model.completions` and `model.responses` sub-objects rather than on the model instance itself. The node patched `model.completionWithRetry` directly, which is `undefined` in 1.x. Patches now apply to both `model.completions` and `model.responses` defensively, with a guard that no-ops if the structure changes again. Also dropped the redacted-then-swap header dance — real headers are now passed straight to the constructor (matching the OpenAI variant), since the post-construction `clientConfig.defaultHeaders` mutation was a fragile workaround whose effect depended on `this.client` being lazily initialized.

### Security
- **`ASCERTA_FILE_DEBUG=1` no longer writes API keys in plaintext.** The Databricks node's `ascertaLog()` was dumping full request/response JSON including `xProxy-Api-Key`, `Authorization`, and `openai_api_key`. New `redactSecrets()` masks those values to `***REDACTED***` before each write. Scoped to Databricks (the only node with file-debug logging).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Auto-populate deployed models** in the Ascerta Databricks (Proxy) chat model node. The `Deployed Model` field is now a searchable resource locator that lists models registered under `system.databricks.<cloudProvider>` in Ascerta's resource catalog, fetched via `GET /api/v1/categories/.../resources` using the configured Ascerta credential. Falls back to a free-text "By Name" mode for models not yet registered. Removes the manual copy-paste step and the typo class of bugs that came with it.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Renamed Databricks credential type** from `databricksApi` to `ascertaDatabricksApi` to avoid a collision with n8n's built-in `databricksApi` credential. n8n 2.19+ ships first-party Databricks support with the same credential type name but different field shape (`host`/`token` vs our `workspaceUrl`/`accessToken`); both registering under the same name caused undefined behavior in the credential registry. Display name changed from "Databricks API" to "Ascerta Databricks API". File and class renamed accordingly. Customers with existing `databricksApi` credentials in this package must recreate them as `Ascerta Databricks API`; zero affected at time of rename (no production deployments).

### Added
- `xProxy-PriceAs-Resource` header now sent by all proxy paths: Ascerta Proxy (all five providers) and the LangChain chat model nodes (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Databricks). The value is the model name or serving endpoint name, depending on provider. Azure already sent this header; the addition brings the others in line. Required for Ascerta pricing engine to resolve per-model rates within a category.
- "Databricks" option in the Cloud Provider dropdown on both the Ascerta Proxy node (when Databricks provider is selected) and the Ascerta Databricks (Proxy) chat model node, for self-hosted, on-premises, or non-major-cloud deployments using `cloud.databricks.com`-pattern URLs. Sends `xProxy-PriceAs-Category: system.databricks.databricks`. Ascerta pricing-table registration for this category is pending (see sysops Q6).
- `databricksApi` credential wired into the Ascerta Proxy node — when `Provider = Databricks` is selected, the workspace URL and PAT come from a saved n8n credential rather than inline fields.
- `authenticate` block on the Ascerta Databricks API credential.
- Credential icons for Ascerta API and Ascerta Databricks API credential types.
- External codex metadata file (`Ascerta.node.json`).
- Deployment & Configuration Guide for self-hosted n8n (`docs/deployment-guide.md`).
- `CLAUDE.md` project guidance.
- `SBOM.md` software bill of materials.

### Changed
- **Drop cloud/selfhosted build profile toggle.** The `set-package-nodes.js` script and the `build:cloud` / `build:selfhosted` npm scripts have been removed. `package.json` now statically registers all 6 nodes — same shape as the previously-published 0.3.0 on npm. The toggle was a footgun: any tag-push could publish the cloud profile (1 node) and regress on customers expecting the selfhosted profile (6 nodes). Selfhosted is now the only supported distribution profile. The `npm run build` script is unchanged in behavior; the convenience aliases just go away.
- HTTP errors now throw `NodeApiError` instead of `NodeOperationError`.
- `Ascerta Databricks (Proxy)` chat model node uses our `ascertaDatabricksApi` credential (`workspaceUrl` / `accessToken`) instead of the external `n8n-nodes-databricks` package's `databricks` credential. Removes the hard dependency on a second community package.

### Fixed
- **Databricks proxy URL pattern.** Replaced the fabricated `<workspace>.ai-gateway.<domain>/mlflow` URL with the correct `<workspace>/serving-endpoints` path. The fabricated `ai-gateway` subdomain doesn't exist as a real Databricks endpoint and was being rejected by Ascerta's proxy with `invalid_provider_host`. Affects both the generic Ascerta Proxy node's Databricks branch and the Ascerta Databricks (Proxy) chat model node.
- Ascerta Proxy node showed no credential setup when `Provider = Databricks` was selected — workspace URL and PAT had to be pasted inline. Now uses the `Ascerta Databricks API` credential dropdown, matching the ergonomics of the other provider chat model nodes.
- Asset copy script now handles credentials directory and `.json` files.
- OpenAI / Anthropic / Azure / Bedrock provider docs upgraded with pricing context, endpoint routing details, and per-provider quirks.
- `eslint` upgraded from 8.57 to 10.x with flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`).
- Replaced `@typescript-eslint/parser` with unified `typescript-eslint` v8 package.
- Removed `gulp` dependency — icon copying uses a zero-dependency Node.js script.
- Removed `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` and `@eslint/eslintrc` — these enforced n8n Cloud scanner rules and were both incompatible with ESLint 10 and irrelevant to the selfhosted-only distribution profile.
- Expanded `.gitignore` to project standards.

### Security
- Resolved all 14 npm audit vulnerabilities (6 high, 8 moderate):
  - `braces@2.3.2` — uncontrolled resource consumption (via gulp)
  - `minimatch@3.1.2` — ReDoS (via eslint 8)
