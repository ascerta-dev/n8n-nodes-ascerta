# Ascerta OpenAI (Proxy)

Routes OpenAI chat model requests through the Ascerta proxy for cost tracking, budget enforcement, and usage analytics.

## Node Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Name | Ascerta OpenAI (Proxy) |
| Node Name | `lmChatAscerta` |
| n8n Type | `@ascerta/n8n-nodes-ascerta.lmChatAscerta` |
| LangChain Class | `ChatOpenAI` (`@langchain/openai`) |
| Proxy Path | `/api/v1/proxy/openai/v1` |

## Credentials

| Credential | Type | Source |
|------------|------|--------|
| Ascerta API | `ascertaApi` | Ascerta community node |
| OpenAI API | `openAiApi` | Built-in n8n credential |

The OpenAI credential provides the API key (`apiKey`) used as the `Authorization: Bearer` header forwarded to OpenAI.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Model | Yes | `gpt-4o` | OpenAI model ID (for example, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, or `o3-mini`). The node does not validate model IDs — any string is forwarded as-is. |

### Options (collapsed)

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Temperature | number | Sampling temperature (0-2) |
| Max Tokens | number | Maximum tokens in the response |
| Top P | number | Nucleus sampling threshold |
| Frequency Penalty | number | Penalize repeated tokens (-2 to 2) |
| Presence Penalty | number | Penalize tokens already in the conversation (-2 to 2) |
| Timeout | number | Request timeout in milliseconds |

## How It Works

```
n8n Workflow
  └─ Ascerta OpenAI (Proxy)
       ├─ Credentials: Ascerta API key + OpenAI API key
       └─ POST {ascertaBaseUrl}/api/v1/proxy/openai/v1/chat/completions
            Headers:
              xProxy-Api-Key:        {ascerta_key}
              xProxy-User-ID:        {userId}          (if set)
              xProxy-UseCase-Name:   {useCaseName}     (if set)
              xProxy-UseCase-ID:     {useCaseId}       (if set)
              Authorization:         Bearer {openai_key}
```

The node instantiates `ChatOpenAI` from `@langchain/openai` with `configuration.baseURL` pointed at `{ascertaBaseUrl}/api/v1/proxy/openai/v1` and `configuration.defaultHeaders` carrying the Ascerta proxy key and any tracking headers. The `Authorization: Bearer {openai_key}` header is set by LangChain from the `apiKey` field — Ascerta passes it through untouched to OpenAI.

OpenAI is the simplest routing path in the Ascerta node family. There is no endpoint URL derivation (compare Databricks, which transforms a workspace URL into an AI Gateway URL), and no special auth exchange. The proxy path is a fixed constant; the model ID is passed directly in the request body.

### Tracking Headers

The following headers are included in every request when their corresponding node fields are non-empty:

| Header | Node Field | Default Value |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| `xProxy-Api-Key` | _(Ascerta credential)_ | Required — always sent |
| `xProxy-User-ID` | User ID | _(empty, omitted)_ |
| `xProxy-UseCase-Name` | Use Case Name | `$workflow.name` (spaces → hyphens) |
| `xProxy-UseCase-ID` | Use Case ID | `{nodeId}` (UUID, stable per canvas node) |
| `xProxy-UseCase-Step` | Use Case Step | Node display name (e.g. `Ascerta OpenAI (Proxy)`); override with a custom step label as needed |

Advanced tracking headers (`xProxy-UseCase-Version`, `xProxy-UseCase-Properties`, `xProxy-Limit-IDs`) are available under the **Advanced Tracking** collection and should only be modified with guidance from Ascerta Support.

## Model IDs

The node does not validate or enumerate model IDs — any string entered in the **Model** field is forwarded directly to OpenAI. The following are common starting points:

| Model ID | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `gpt-4o` | Default. Strong reasoning, multimodal input |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | Smaller, faster, lower cost |
| `gpt-4.1` | Latest generation — verify availability on your OpenAI account |
| `o3-mini` | Reasoning-optimized compact model |

## Known Limitations

- **Organization ID** — OpenAI supports an `OpenAI-Organization` header for routing requests to a specific org. This header is not currently passed through by the Ascerta node. If your account requires it, open a support request with Ascerta.

## OpenAI Pricing

OpenAI charges per token, billed separately for input (prompt) and output (completion). Rates vary by model and are updated periodically on the [OpenAI pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

Ascerta tracks both input and output token counts on every request and converts them to actual dollar cost using the current rate table for the model. The Ascerta dashboard shows per-request cost, per-user cost, and aggregate spend broken down by model and Use Case.

Unlike DBU-based pricing (see [Databricks](databricks.md)), OpenAI pricing is a direct per-token dollar rate with no intermediate unit conversion.

## Migration

The n8n migration toolkit automatically detects the following native nodes and replaces them with this Ascerta node:

- `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi`
- `lmChatOpenRouter`

Existing OpenAI credentials are passed through automatically.
