# Ascerta Anthropic (Proxy)

Routes Anthropic Claude chat model requests through the Ascerta proxy for cost tracking, budget enforcement, and usage analytics.

## Node Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Name | Ascerta Anthropic (Proxy) |
| Node Name | `lmChatAscertaAnthropic` |
| n8n Type | `n8n-nodes-ascerta.lmChatAscertaAnthropic` |
| LangChain Class | `ChatAnthropic` (`@langchain/anthropic`) |
| Proxy Path | `/api/v1/proxy/anthropic` |

## Credentials

| Credential | Type | Source |
|------------|------|--------|
| Ascerta API | `ascertaApi` | Ascerta community node |
| Anthropic API | `anthropicApi` | Built-in n8n credential |

Both credentials are required. The Ascerta API key authenticates with the proxy; the Anthropic API key is forwarded to Anthropic for model authorization.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Model | Yes | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic model ID (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-6`) |

### Options (collapsed)

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| Maximum Number of Tokens | number | 4096 | Maximum tokens to generate in the response |
| Sampling Temperature | number | 0.7 | Randomness control (0–1). Hidden when Extended Thinking is enabled. |
| Top K | number | -1 | Removes low-probability "long tail" responses. `-1` disables it. Hidden when Extended Thinking is enabled. |
| Top P | number | 1 | Nucleus sampling threshold (0–1). Hidden when Extended Thinking is enabled. |
| Enable Thinking | boolean | false | Enable Claude's extended thinking / reasoning mode |
| Thinking Budget (Tokens) | number | 10000 | Maximum tokens the model may use for thinking. Minimum 1024. Only shown when Enable Thinking is true. |

## How It Works

```
n8n Workflow
  └─ Ascerta Anthropic (Proxy)
       ├─ Credentials: Ascerta API key + Anthropic API key
       └─ POST {ascertaBaseUrl}/api/v1/proxy/anthropic/v1/messages
            Headers:
              xProxy-Api-Key:          {ascerta_key}
              xProxy-User-ID:          {userId}           (if set)
              xProxy-UseCase-Name:     {useCaseName}      (if set)
              xProxy-UseCase-ID:       {useCaseId}        (if set)
              xProxy-UseCase-Version:  {useCaseVersion}   (if set)

              xProxy-Limit-IDs:        {limitIds}         (if set)
              x-api-key:               {anthropic_key}
              anthropic-version:       2023-06-01
```

The node uses `ChatAnthropic` from `@langchain/anthropic` with `anthropicApiUrl` pointed at the Ascerta proxy (`{ascertaBaseUrl}/api/v1/proxy/anthropic`). Ascerta intercepts the request, records cost and usage data, applies any active budget limits, then transparently forwards it to Anthropic's Messages API.

**Auth split:** The Ascerta API key travels in `defaultHeaders` as `xProxy-Api-Key`. The Anthropic API key is passed to the `ChatAnthropic` constructor as `anthropicApiKey`, which the LangChain SDK sends as the standard `x-api-key` header. Ascerta's proxy reads `x-api-key` to authenticate with Anthropic on your behalf.

**Tracking headers** (`xProxy-*`) are only added when the corresponding tracking field is populated. They carry cost attribution metadata — user ID, use case name/ID/version/step, custom properties, and budget limit references — that Ascerta uses to aggregate spend by dimension.

## Extended Thinking

Extended Thinking is Claude's extended reasoning mode: the model silently works through a problem before producing a final response. It trades higher token consumption for measurably improved accuracy on complex tasks (math, multi-step reasoning, ambiguous instructions).

### How the Node Handles It

When **Enable Thinking** is `true`, the node injects `invocationKwargs` into the `ChatAnthropic` constructor:

```json
{
  "thinking": {
    "type": "enabled",
    "budget_tokens": 10000
  },
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "temperature": undefined,
  "top_k": undefined,
  "top_p": undefined
}
```

The `undefined` values are intentional — the Anthropic API **rejects requests** that include `temperature`, `top_k`, or `top_p` when thinking is enabled. Setting them to `undefined` ensures the LangChain SDK omits those fields from the serialized request body. The n8n UI hides these options automatically when Enable Thinking is checked.

### Thinking Budget vs. Max Tokens — Two Separate Limits

These are independent token ceilings that serve different purposes:

| Setting | Controls | What Happens When Hit |
|---------|----------|-----------------------|
| Thinking Budget | How many tokens the model may spend *reasoning internally* | Thinking stops; model proceeds to final answer with what it has |
| Max Tokens | How many tokens the *final response* may contain | Response is truncated |

A common misconfiguration is setting Max Tokens too low while enabling a large Thinking Budget. If Max Tokens < what the model needs for its answer (after thinking), the response truncates. Rule of thumb: set Max Tokens to at least as large as the expected output, independent of the Thinking Budget.

**Minimum Thinking Budget:** 1024 tokens (enforced by the UI). Values below this are rejected by the Anthropic API.

### Cost Impact

Thinking tokens are billed by Anthropic at the **output token rate** — the same rate as the visible response. A request with a 10,000-token thinking budget can therefore incur up to 10,000 additional output-rate tokens on top of the visible response, even though the thinking content is not returned to the caller.

Ascerta tracks thinking tokens through the custom token usage parser (`llmOutput.usage.input_tokens` + `output_tokens`), so thinking costs appear correctly in Ascerta's cost dashboards and are counted against any active budget limits.

**Practical guidance:** Start with the default 10,000-token budget and monitor Ascerta's token usage dashboard before increasing it. For production workflows, set a Limit in Ascerta to cap spending if thinking consumption exceeds expectations.

## Anthropic Pricing

Anthropic charges per token — input and output are priced separately. Current rates vary by model; refer to [Anthropic's pricing page](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing) for the latest figures.

Key billing points for this node:

- **Input tokens** — prompt text, conversation history, system prompts.
- **Output tokens** — the visible model response.
- **Thinking tokens** — billed at the output token rate; tracked separately by Ascerta. They do not appear in the response but count against your Anthropic invoice and any active Ascerta Limits.

Ascerta records all three token categories (via the custom `tokensUsageParser`) and surfaces them in cost breakdowns and Use Case rollups.

## Migration

The n8n migration toolkit automatically detects the following native node and replaces it with this Ascerta node:

- `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatAnthropic`

Existing Anthropic credentials are passed through automatically. The model name is preserved from the original node configuration.
