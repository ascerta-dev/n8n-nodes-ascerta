## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing the node, confirm you have everything in the list below. Missing any one of these will block you at a specific step — it's faster to check now.

### Ascerta Account & Instance

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Ascerta account | Provisioned by the Ascerta team. Contact [Ascerta support](https://www.ascerta.com/support) if your account has not been set up yet. |
| Ascerta Base URL | Your dedicated instance URL — for example, `https://api.yourcompany.ascerta.com`. **This is NOT `api.ascerta.com`.** Every customer gets a dedicated endpoint; using the wrong URL is the single most common setup mistake and produces misleading errors. |
| Ascerta API key | Available from your Ascerta dashboard after account provisioning. |

### Provider Credentials

You need credentials for each LLM provider you intend to route through Ascerta. Collect these before you begin — you will enter them during [Section 4: Credential Setup](#4-credential-setup).

| Provider | What You Need |
|----------|---------------|
| OpenAI | API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| Anthropic | API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| Azure OpenAI | Resource name (or full endpoint URL), API key, and API version |
| AWS Bedrock | Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, optional Session Token, and AWS region where Bedrock is enabled |
| Databricks | Workspace URL and a Personal Access Token (PAT) with permissions to call the model serving endpoint |

### n8n Instance

- Self-hosted n8n, latest stable release recommended.
- Community node installation must be enabled (see [Section 3](#3-environment-configuration)).
- Network access from the n8n host to your Ascerta Base URL on port 443.

---

## 2. Installation

Choose the path that matches how your n8n instance is managed.

### Option A: Community Node UI

This is the simplest path for instances managed through the n8n web interface.

1. Open n8n and go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
2. Click **Install**.
3. Enter the package name: `@ascerta/n8n-nodes-ascerta`
4. Accept the community node security prompt.
5. Click **Install** to confirm.
6. **Restart n8n.** The node is not available until the process restarts.

After restart, search for "Ascerta" in the node panel to confirm the nodes appear.

### Option B: Docker Image

For teams managing n8n via Docker, bake the package into your image so every container starts with the node pre-installed.

**Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM n8nio/n8n:latest
USER root
RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install @ascerta/n8n-nodes-ascerta
USER node
RUN rm -rf /home/node/.n8n/.cache
```

> **Production note:** The example above uses `n8nio/n8n:latest`. For production deployments, pin to a specific n8n version tag (for example, `n8nio/n8n:1.85.0`) to prevent unintended upgrades from breaking your workflows.

Build and tag this image, then reference it in your compose file.

**docker-compose.yml excerpt:**

```yaml
services:
  n8n:
    image: your-registry/n8n-ascerta:latest   # Use your tagged image above
    environment:
      - N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
```

The `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE` variable is required for Ascerta nodes to function as AI Agent tools. See [Section 3](#3-environment-configuration) for details.

---

## 3. Environment Configuration

### Required Variable

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE` | `true` | Allows community nodes (including Ascerta) to be used as tools inside the n8n AI Agent node. Without this, the node installs but cannot be attached to an AI Agent. |

### How to Set It

**Docker / docker-compose**

Add the variable under `environment:` in your compose file as shown in Option B above. Recreate the container after changing compose files:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

**Systemd / bare metal**

Add the export to the startup script or service unit that launches n8n. For a systemd unit:

```ini
[Service]
Environment="N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/n8n start
```

Reload and restart the service after editing:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart n8n
```

For bare-metal starts via shell script, add:

```bash
export N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
```

before running `n8n start`.

---

## 4. Credential Setup

Ascerta nodes require two credentials per workflow: one for Ascerta itself, and one for the upstream provider. Set up Ascerta first, then configure provider credentials.

### 4.1 Ascerta API Credential

**Credential type:** `Ascerta API` (provided by this community node)

Navigate to **Settings > Credentials > New Credential > Ascerta API**.

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| API Key | Your Ascerta API key | From the Ascerta dashboard |
| Base URL | `https://api.yourcompany.ascerta.com` | **Your dedicated instance URL.** Do not leave this as a default or placeholder. Do not use `api.ascerta.com`. If you are unsure of your Base URL, contact [Ascerta support](https://www.ascerta.com/support). |

> **Common mistake:** Leaving the Base URL as a default or using the wrong endpoint. If requests fail with 401 or connection errors and your API key is correct, the Base URL is almost always the cause. Double-check it before debugging anything else.

---

### 4.2 OpenAI API Credential

**Credential type:** `OpenAI API` (built-in n8n credential)

If you already have an OpenAI credential in n8n, you can reuse it — no need to create a duplicate.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| API Key | Your OpenAI API key |

---

### 4.3 Anthropic API Credential

**Credential type:** `Anthropic API` (built-in n8n credential)

If you already have an Anthropic credential in n8n, reuse it.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| API Key | Your Anthropic API key |

---

### 4.4 Azure OpenAI API Credential

**Credential type:** `Azure OpenAI API` (built-in n8n credential)

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Resource Name | Your Azure OpenAI resource name | e.g., `my-openai-resource` |
| API Key | Your Azure OpenAI API key | From Azure portal > your resource > Keys and Endpoint |
| API Version | e.g., `2024-08-01-preview` | Can also be set per-node in the node parameters |

> **Endpoint resolution note:** The Ascerta Azure node constructs the upstream endpoint from your resource name using the standard Azure pattern (`https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com`). If your Azure deployment uses a custom domain or a non-standard endpoint URL, enter the full endpoint URL in the Resource Name field instead of just the resource name — the node handles both forms.

---

### 4.5 AWS Credentials (Bedrock)

**Credential type:** `AWS` (built-in n8n credential)

AWS SigV4 request signing is handled automatically by the Ascerta Bedrock node. You only need to supply the credentials.

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Access Key ID | Your AWS Access Key ID | IAM user or role with Bedrock invoke permissions |
| Secret Access Key | Your AWS Secret Access Key | |
| Session Token | Optional | Required only for temporary credentials (STS / assumed roles) |
| Region | e.g., `us-east-1` | Must match the region where your Bedrock model is enabled |

---

### 4.6 Databricks Credential

**Credential type:** `Ascerta Databricks API` (provided by this community node)

> **No extra package required.** This package ships its own `ascertaDatabricksApi` credential type — namespaced to avoid collision with n8n's built-in `databricksApi` credential, which uses different field names. You do not need to install `n8n-nodes-databricks`.

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Workspace URL | `https://your-workspace.azuredatabricks.net` | Full URL including scheme, no trailing slash. AWS/GCP workspaces use `https://{id}.cloud.databricks.com` |
| Personal Access Token | Your Databricks PAT | Generate from Databricks UI: User Settings > Developer > Access Tokens |

---

## 5. Verification

Run this smoke test after completing installation and credential setup. It confirms the node is installed, the credentials work, and requests are reaching your Ascerta instance.

### Build the Smoke Test Workflow

1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Chat Trigger** node.
3. Add an **AI Agent** node. Connect the Manual Chat Trigger to it.
4. In the AI Agent node, click the **Chat Model** connector and add a **Ascerta OpenAI (Proxy)** node.
5. Configure the Ascerta OpenAI node:
   - **Ascerta API credential:** select the credential you created in [Section 4.1](#41-ascerta-api-credential)
   - **OpenAI API credential:** select the credential from [Section 4.2](#42-openai-api-credential)
   - **Model:** `gpt-4o` (or any model available on your OpenAI account)
   - Under **Options**, set:
     - **User ID:** `smoke-test`
     - **Use Case Name:** `verification`
     - **Debug Logging:** enabled

6. Save the workflow.
7. Click **Chat** and send any message (e.g., "Hello").

### Expected Debug Log Output

With Debug Logging enabled, the n8n execution log will contain entries like this:

```
[Ascerta OpenAI] ──── DEBUG (item 0) ────
[Ascerta OpenAI] model="gpt-4o" baseURL="https://api.yourcompany.ascerta.com/api/v1/proxy/openai/v1"
[Ascerta OpenAI] Headers: {
  "xProxy-Api-Key": "pi_live_****",
  "xProxy-User-ID": "smoke-test",
  "xProxy-UseCase-Name": "verification"
}
```

Confirm that `baseURL` shows **your dedicated Ascerta instance URL**, not `api.ascerta.com`. Confirm the `xProxy-Api-Key` is masked but present. If the workflow executes and returns a response, your installation is working.

Check your Ascerta dashboard — the verification request should appear in usage data within a few minutes.

### Common Failures at This Stage

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "Ascerta OpenAI" not in node panel | Node not installed or cache not cleared | See [Option A](#option-a-community-node-ui) restart step or clear `~/.n8n/.cache` |
| Cannot attach node to AI Agent | `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE` not set | See [Section 3](#3-environment-configuration) |
| 401 Unauthorized from Ascerta | Wrong API key or wrong Base URL | Recheck [Section 4.1](#41-ascerta-api-credential) |
| 401 from OpenAI | OpenAI credential invalid or expired | Verify API key at platform.openai.com |
| No data in Ascerta dashboard | Base URL points to wrong instance | Confirm your dedicated URL with Ascerta support |

---

## 6. Tracking & Attribution

Ascerta's value comes from being able to slice cost and usage data in ways that matter to your organization. The tracking fields give you control over how that data is labeled.

**Think about it this way: how do you want to answer these questions?**

- "Who is using the most tokens?" → use **User ID**
- "Which workflows are driving the most cost?" → use **Use Case Name**
- "Which specific execution caused this spike?" → use **Use Case ID**
- "Which step in a multi-step workflow is the expensive one?" → use **Use Case Step**

### Core Attribution Fields

| Field | n8n Parameter | What It Does | Recommendation |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| User ID | `userId` | Tags the request to a person or system account | Set to the n8n user, authenticated end user, or service identity |
| Use Case Name | `useCaseName` | Tags the request to a workflow or business purpose | Set to something readable: `invoice-extraction`, `support-triage`, `code-review` |
| Use Case ID | `useCaseId` | Identifies the logical use case (one canvas node = one use case) | Defaults to `{{ $nodeId }}` — the node's stable UUID. Override only when you need a correlation ID from an external system |
| Use Case Step | `useCaseStep` | Tags a specific node within a workflow | Defaults to the node display name (e.g. `Ascerta Databricks (Proxy)`) — override with a custom label when you have multiple Ascerta nodes in one workflow |

### Advanced Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Use Case Version | string | Track model or prompt versions — useful when A/B testing prompts. For example, `v2.1-chain-of-thought` |
| Use Case Properties | JSON object | Arbitrary key-value metadata for filtering in the dashboard. For example, `{"team": "finance", "env": "prod"}` |
| Limit IDs | string (comma-separated) | Associate this request with one or more Ascerta Limits by ID |
| Debug Logging | boolean | Emit request details to n8n execution log. Enable during setup and troubleshooting; disable in production to reduce log volume |

### Practical Setup Recommendations

For most deployments:

- **Always set User ID and Use Case Name.** These are the two fields Ascerta dashboards filter on most.
- Use **n8n expressions** to make these dynamic: `={{ $json.userId }}` or `={{ $workflow.name }}`.
- If you run multiple environments (dev, staging, prod), encode the environment in Use Case Properties rather than in the Use Case Name itself.
- Leave Use Case ID and Use Case Step as defaults unless you have a specific correlation requirement.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### First Step: Enable Debug Logging

Before investigating any issue, turn on Debug Logging in the Ascerta node's Options. This emits the full request configuration — Base URL, masked API key, and all tracking headers — to the n8n execution log. Most issues are immediately visible once you can see these values.

**Accessing logs:**

- **Docker:** `docker logs <container-name> --follow`
- **Systemd:** `journalctl -u n8n -f`
- **Bare metal:** Check the terminal or log file where n8n was started, or n8n's built-in execution log in the UI (open the execution, click the node, check the Output panel for console messages)

### Common Issues

| Issue | Symptom | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|---------|-------|------------|
| Node not in palette | "Ascerta OpenAI" missing from node search | n8n cache not cleared after install | Clear `~/.n8n/.cache` and restart n8n |
| Cannot connect node to AI Agent | Node appears but cannot be wired as Chat Model | `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true` not set | Set the environment variable and restart n8n (see [Section 3](#3-environment-configuration)) |
| Invalid API Key / authentication error | Execution fails with 401 from Ascerta | Wrong API key, or wrong Base URL pointing to a different instance | Re-enter the API key; confirm the Base URL is your dedicated instance URL |
| 401 from upstream provider | Execution fails with 401 from OpenAI / Anthropic / Azure | Provider credential invalid or expired | Test the provider key directly (curl or provider console); update credential in n8n |
| No data in Ascerta dashboard | Workflows succeed but usage doesn't appear | Base URL is incorrect — requests are reaching the wrong endpoint | Enable Debug Logging and confirm the `baseURL` in the log matches your dedicated instance |
| Azure `DeploymentNotFound` | Azure requests fail with deployment not found error | Deployment name doesn't match, or endpoint resolution is wrong | Verify the deployment name in Azure portal; if using a custom domain, enter the full endpoint URL in the credential's Resource Name field |
| Bedrock signature mismatch | AWS requests fail with signature errors | Region in credential doesn't match the region where the model is enabled | Confirm the region in your AWS credential matches your Bedrock model deployment region |
| Databricks `RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` | Databricks requests fail with resource error | Workspace URL is incorrect or the model serving endpoint doesn't exist | Confirm the full workspace URL (including `https://`); verify the endpoint exists in Databricks UI > Serving |
| Network timeout | Requests time out with no response | Firewall or network policy blocking outbound HTTPS from n8n host to Ascerta | Confirm the n8n host can reach your Ascerta Base URL on port 443: `curl -v https://api.yourcompany.ascerta.com` |
